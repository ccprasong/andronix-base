            Here's the breakdown of how we handle your data at Andronix
          </p>

          <p class="font-bold text-lg text-white my-3">
            Registering with email and password
          </p>
          <p>When you sign up using email and password on Andronix, we send your email and password to our server (we
            use Google’s Firebase for the backend of the app). The email and password are all stored encrypted safely.
            We do not store your emails on a separate database, which throws the possibilities to have breach in the
            database due to poor security rules. Authentication is handled by Google’s own <a
              target="_blank"   href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth"
            >Firebase Authentication</a>. This
            also limits the possibility of us selling the actual data or in general spamming emails with promotional
            content.</p>
          <p class="font-bold text-lg text-white my-3">
            Google sign-in/register
          </p>
          <p>When using Google sign-in, the entire OAuth process is handled by <a
            target="_blank"  href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth"
          >Firebase Authentication</a>. We only have
            access to your email and your profile picture and nothing else. We neither store your email or your profile
            picture on a separate database. Your picture is fetched in real-time using Google’s APIs.</p>

          <p class="font-bold text-lg text-white my-3">
            In-app purchases
          </p>
          <p>We always store the minimum amount of data that is enough to identify you as our user but can not be used
            to identify you with any metadata by a third party. Note - This is only applicable to the systems that we
            operate and have under control and does not include any of the external services that we use or might use in
            the future. As an example, if you use a Google service and have a Google account prior to using Andronix,
            there's a good chance that Google might track you inside Andronix as well with all the Firebase products
            that we use.</p>
          <p class="font-bold">In a nutshell, the fore-mentioned policies of handling your data is only applicable
            within our systems. This cannot personally identify you as an individual unless your email is associated
            elsewhere.</p>

          <p class="font-bold text-lg text-white my-3">
            Purchases made outside the app
          </p>
          <p>Andronix currently uses <a href="https://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> as the payment provider along with <a
            target="_blank"   href="https://paypal.com"
          >PayPal</a> which is actually integrated within Razorpay. The present purchase flow requires users to add the
            following details as "Billing Information"</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First Name</li>
            <li>Last Name</li>
            <li>Billing address</li>
            <li>Postal code</li>
            <li>Country</li>
            <li>State</li>
            <li>Email</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="prose-sm">* This list might change in the future. This is helpful in preventing credit card fraud
            and other types of fraud. It also mandatory in most of the States in the world.</p>
          <p>This entire data is stored on Razorpay's backend and our servers never touch this. This is also how your
            payments are handled, we never see them or make one enter their financial information on your website.</p>
          <p class="font-bold">In a nutshell, the fore-mentioned policies of handling your data is only applicable
            within our systems. This cannot personally identify you as an individual unless your email is associated
            elsewhere.</p>


          <p class="font-bold text-lg text-white my-3">
            Use of Analytics and Crashlytics</p>
          <p>We use Google Analytics that comprises of Crashlytics. Analytics enables us to take a look at what users
            are using the most in the app and improve the UX of the app. Whereas Crashlytics helps us to identify the
            issues and crashes automatically before a user manually reports the crashes.</p>
          <p class="font-bold">We don’t use the meta data is anyway other than improving the user-experience. It is not
            stored on our servers.</p>
